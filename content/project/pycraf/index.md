title: 'Spectrum management compatibility studies with Python: Pycraf'
summary: "The pycraf Python package provides functions and procedures for
spectrum-management compatibility studies, such as calculating the
interference levels at a radio telescope produced from a radio broadcasting
tower. It includes an implementation of [ITU-R Recommendation
P.452](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.452-18-202310-I/en) for
calculating path propagation loss (attenuation) between a transmitter and a
receiver. It supports working with GIS data for height-profile generation,
includes a full implementation of
[ITU-R Rec. P.676](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.676-13-202208-I/en) for
atmospheric modelling, and provides various antenna patterns necessary for
compatibility studies (e.g., RAS, IMT, fixed-service links)."

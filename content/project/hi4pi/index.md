title: 'HI4PI: An all-sky survey of galactic hydrogen'
summary: "Using data from the [Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2015/06/aa25859-15/aa25859-15.html)
and the [Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2016/01/aa27007-15/aa27007-15.html)
we constructed a full 4-PI data set of the neutral atomic hydrogen in the
Milky Way. Its main aim is to replace the older Leiden/Argentine/Bonn Survey (LAB).
HI4PI has much better angular resolution and sensitivity than LAB, and it
features full angular sampling. "

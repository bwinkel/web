Benjamin Winkel is a professional radio astronomer, who got his Ph.D. at the
University of Bonn in 2009. He had a leading role in the Effelberg-Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS)
and the HI4PI Survey, which combined EBHIS with Parkes data to create a census
of the neutral atomic hydrogen in the Milky Way and its halo. Benjamin has
thousands of hours of observing experience with major European radio
telescopes and is an expert in the field of radio astronomy data processing
and calibration. Since a few years, he is also very active in the field of
spectrum management, being one of the German delegates in the European
Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies (CRAF), advocating for protecting
radio astronomy from interference caused by anthropogenic sources. Together
with his CRAF colleagues, Benjamin participates in meetings and conferences
of the International Telecommunication Union and other organisations, where
important decisions are being made which could impact astronomer's access to
the sky for decades.

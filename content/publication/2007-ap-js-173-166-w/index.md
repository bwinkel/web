abstract: Least-squares frequency switching (LSFS) is a new method to reconstruct
  signal and gain function (known as bandpass or baseline) from spectral line observations
  using the frequency switching method. LSFS utilizes not only two but a set of three
  or more local oscillator (LO) frequencies. The reconstruction is based on a least-squares
  fitting scheme. Here we present a detailed investigation on the stability of the
  LSFS method in a statistical sense and test the robustness against radio frequency
  interference (RFI), receiver gain instabilities, and continuum sources. It turns
  out that the LSFS method is indeed a very powerful method and is robust against
  most of these problems. Nevertheless, LSFS fails in presence of RFI signals or strong
  line emission. We present solutions to overcome these limitations using a flagging
  mechanism or remapping of measured signals, respectively.

 abstract = {Least-squares frequency switching (LSFS) is a new method to reconstruct
signal and gain function (known as bandpass or baseline) from
spectral line observations using the frequency switching method.
LSFS utilizes not only two but a set of three or more local
oscillator (LO) frequencies. The reconstruction is based on a
least-squares fitting scheme. Here we present a detailed
investigation on the stability of the LSFS method in a
statistical sense and test the robustness against radio
frequency interference (RFI), receiver gain instabilities, and
continuum sources. It turns out that the LSFS method is indeed a
very powerful method and is robust against most of these
problems. Nevertheless, LSFS fails in presence of RFI signals or
strong line emission. We present solutions to overcome these
limitations using a flagging mechanism or remapping of measured
signals, respectively.},

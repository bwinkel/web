 abstract = {Context. Recent submillimeter and far-infrared wavelength observations
of absorption in the rotational ground-state lines of various
simple molecules against distant Galactic continuum sources have
opened the possibility of studying the chemistry of diffuse
molecular clouds throughout the Milky Way. In order to calculate
abundances, the column densities of molecular and atomic
hydrogen, H I, must be known. \ Aims: We aim at
determining the atomic hydrogen column densities for diffuse
clouds located on the sight lines toward a sample of prominent
high-mass star-forming regions that were intensely studied with
the HIFI instrument onboard Herschel. \ Methods:
Based on Jansky Very Large Array data, we employ the 21 cm H I
absorption-line technique to construct profiles of the H I
opacity versus radial velocity toward our target sources. These
profiles are combined with lower resolution archival data of
extended H I emission to calculate the H I column densities of
the individual clouds along the sight lines. We employ Bayesian
inference to estimate the uncertainties of the derived
quantities. \ Results: Our study delivers reliable
estimates of the atomic hydrogen column density for a large
number of diffuse molecular clouds at various Galactocentric
distances. Together with column densities of molecular hydrogen
derived from its surrogates observed with HIFI, the measurements
can be used to characterize the clouds and investigate the
dependence of their chemistry on the molecular fraction, for
example. \\The data sets are available

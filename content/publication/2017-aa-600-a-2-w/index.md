abstract: "Context. Recent submillimeter and far-infrared wavelength observations
  of absorption in the rotational ground-state lines of various simple molecules against
  distant Galactic continuum sources have opened the possibility of studying the chemistry
  of diffuse molecular clouds throughout the Milky Way. In order to calculate abundances,
  the column densities of molecular and atomic hydrogen, H I, must be known.  Aims:
  We aim at determining the atomic hydrogen column densities for diffuse clouds located
  on the sight lines toward a sample of prominent high-mass star-forming regions that
  were intensely studied with the HIFI instrument onboard Herschel.  Methods: Based
  on Jansky Very Large Array data, we employ the 21 cm H I absorption-line technique
  to construct profiles of the H I opacity versus radial velocity toward our target
  sources. These profiles are combined with lower resolution archival data of extended
  H I emission to calculate the H I column densities of the individual clouds along
  the sight lines. We employ Bayesian inference to estimate the uncertainties of the
  derived quantities.  Results: Our study delivers reliable estimates of the atomic
  hydrogen column density for a large number of diffuse molecular clouds at various
  Galactocentric distances. Together with column densities of molecular hydrogen derived
  from its surrogates observed with HIFI, the measurements can be used to characterize
  the clouds and investigate the dependence of their chemistry on the molecular fraction,
  for example. The data sets are available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=``http://cdsarc.u-strasb

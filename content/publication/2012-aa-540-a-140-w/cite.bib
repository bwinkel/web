 abstract = {Position and frequency switching techniques used for the removal of the
bandpass dependence of radio astronomical spectra are presented
and discussed in detail. Both methods are widely used, although
the frequency dependence of the system temperature and/or noise
diode is often neglected. This leads to systematic errors in the
calibration that potentially have a significant impact on
scientific results, especially when using large-bandwidth
receivers or performing statistical analyses. We present methods
to derive an unbiased calibration using a noise diode, which is
part of many heterodyne receivers. We compare the proposed
methods and describe the advantages and bottlenecks of the
various approaches. Monte Carlo simulations are used to
qualitatively investigate both systematics and the error
distribution of the reconstructed flux estimates about the
correct flux values for the new methods but also the
``classical'' case. Finally, the determination of the frequency-
dependent noise temperature of the calibration diode using hot-
cold measurements or observations of well-known continuum
sources is also briefly discussed.},

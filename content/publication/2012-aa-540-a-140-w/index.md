abstract: Position and frequency switching techniques used for the removal of the
  bandpass dependence of radio astronomical spectra are presented and discussed in
  detail. Both methods are widely used, although the frequency dependence of the system
  temperature and/or noise diode is often neglected. This leads to systematic errors
  in the calibration that potentially have a significant impact on scientific results,
  especially when using large-bandwidth receivers or performing statistical analyses.
  We present methods to derive an unbiased calibration using a noise diode, which
  is part of many heterodyne receivers. We compare the proposed methods and describe
  the advantages and bottlenecks of the various approaches. Monte Carlo simulations
  are used to qualitatively investigate both systematics and the error distribution
  of the reconstructed flux estimates about the correct flux values for the new methods
  but also the ``classical'' case. Finally, the determination of the frequency- dependent
  noise temperature of the calibration diode using hot- cold measurements or observations
  of well-known continuum sources is also briefly discussed.

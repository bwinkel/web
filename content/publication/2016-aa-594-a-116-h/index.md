abstract: "Context. Measurement of the Galactic neutral atomic hydrogen (H I) column
  density, N$_H I$, and brightness temperatures, T$_B$, is of high scientific value
  for a broad range of astrophysical disciplines. In the past two decades, one of
  the most-used legacy H I datasets has been the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn Survey (LAB).\
  \  Aims: We release the H I 4ensuremathπ survey (HI4PI), an all-sky database of
  Galactic H I, which supersedes the LAB survey.  Methods: The HI4PI survey is based
  on data from the recently completed first coverage of the Effelsberg-Bonn H I Survey
  (EBHIS) and from the third revision of the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS). EBHIS
  and GASS share similar angular resolution and match well in sensitivity. Combined,
  they are ideally suited to be a successor to LAB.  Results: The new HI4PI survey
  outperforms the LAB in angular resolution (ensuremathǎrtheta$_FWHM$ = 16´´.2) and
  sensitivity (ensuremathσ$_rms$ = 43 mK). Moreover, it has full spatial sampling
  and thus overcomes a major drawback of LAB, which severely undersamples the sky.
  We publish all-sky column density maps of the neutral atomic hydrogen in the Milky
  Way, along with full spectroscopic data, in several map projections including HEALPix.

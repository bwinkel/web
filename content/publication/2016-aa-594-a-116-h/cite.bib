 abstract = {Context. Measurement of the Galactic neutral atomic hydrogen (H I)
column density, N$_H I$, and brightness temperatures, T$_B$,
is of high scientific value for a broad range of astrophysical
disciplines. In the past two decades, one of the most-used
legacy H I datasets has been the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn Survey
(LAB). \ Aims: We release the H I
4\ensuremathπ survey (HI4PI), an all-sky database of
Galactic H I, which supersedes the LAB survey. \
Methods: The HI4PI survey is based on data from the recently
completed first coverage of the Effelsberg-Bonn H I Survey
(EBHIS) and from the third revision of the Galactic All-Sky
Survey (GASS). EBHIS and GASS share similar angular resolution
and match well in sensitivity. Combined, they are ideally suited
to be a successor to LAB. \ Results: The new HI4PI
survey outperforms the LAB in angular resolution
(\ensuremathǎrtheta$_FWHM$ =
16´´.2) and sensitivity
(\ensuremathσ$_rms$ = 43 mK). Moreover, it has full
spatial sampling and thus overcomes a major drawback of LAB,
which severely undersamples the sky. We publish all-sky column
density maps of the neutral atomic hydrogen in the Milky Way,
along with full spectroscopic data, in several map projections
including HEALPix. \I̋4PI datasets

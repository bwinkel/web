abstract: 'Context. The Parkes Galactic all-sky survey (GASS) is a survey of Galactic
  atomic hydrogen (H i) emission in the southern sky observed with the Parkes 64-m
  Radio Telescope. The first data release was published by McClure-Griffiths et al.
  (2009).  Aims: We remove instrumental effects that affect the GASS and present the
  second data release.  Methods: We calculate the stray-radiation by convolving the
  all- sky response of the Parkes antenna with the brightness temperature distribution
  from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) all sky 21-cm line survey, with major contributions
  from the 30-m dish of the Instituto Argentino de Radioastronomı́a (IAR) in the southern
  sky. Remaining instrumental baselines are corrected using the LAB data for a first
  guess of emission-free baseline regions. Radio frequency interference is removed
  by median filtering.  Results: After applying these corrections to the GASS we find
  an excellent agreement with the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) survey. The GASS is
  the highest spatial resolution, most sensitive, and is currently the most accurate
  H i survey of the Galactic H i emission in the southern sky. We provide a web interface
  for generation and download of FITS cubes.'

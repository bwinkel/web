 abstract = {Context. The Parkes Galactic all-sky survey (GASS) is a survey of
Galactic atomic hydrogen (H i) emission in the southern sky
observed with the Parkes 64-m Radio Telescope. The first data
release was published by McClure-Griffiths et al. (2009).
\ Aims: We remove instrumental effects that affect
the GASS and present the second data release. \
Methods: We calculate the stray-radiation by convolving the all-
sky response of the Parkes antenna with the brightness
temperature distribution from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB)
all sky 21-cm line survey, with major contributions from the
30-m dish of the Instituto Argentino de Radioastronomı́a
(IAR) in the southern sky. Remaining instrumental baselines are
corrected using the LAB data for a first guess of emission-free
baseline regions. Radio frequency interference is removed by
median filtering. \ Results: After applying these
corrections to the GASS we find an excellent agreement with the
Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) survey. The GASS is the highest
spatial resolution, most sensitive, and is currently the most
accurate H i survey of the Galactic H i emission in the southern
sky. We provide a web interface for generation and download of
FITS cubes.},

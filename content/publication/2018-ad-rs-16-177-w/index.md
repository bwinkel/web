abstract: We developed the <TT>pycraf</TT> Python package, which provides functions
  and procedures for various tasks related to spectrum- management compatibility studies.
  This includes an implementation of ITU-R Rec. P.452 (ITU-R, 2015), which allows
  to calculate the path attenuation arising from the distance and terrain properties
  between an interferer and the victim service. A typical example would be the calculation
  of interference levels at a radio telescope produced from a radio broadcasting tower.
  Furthermore, <TT>pycraf</TT> provides functionality to calculate atmospheric attenuation
  as proposed in ITU-R Rec. P.676 (ITU-R, 2013). Using the rich ecosystem of scientific
  Python libraries and our <TT>pycraf</TT> package, we performed a large number of
  compatibility studies. Here, we will highlight a recent case study, where we analysed
  the potential harm that the next-generation cell-phone standard 5G could bring to
  observations at a radio observatory. For this we implemented a Monte-Carlo simulation
  to deal with the quasi- statistical spatial distribution of base stations and user
  devices around the radio astronomy station.

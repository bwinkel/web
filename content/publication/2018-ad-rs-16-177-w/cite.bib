 abstract = {We developed the <TT>pycraf</TT> Python package, which provides
functions and procedures for various tasks related to spectrum-
management compatibility studies. This includes an
implementation of ITU-R Rec. P.452 (ITU-R, 2015), which allows
to calculate the path attenuation arising from the distance and
terrain properties between an interferer and the victim service.
A typical example would be the calculation of interference
levels at a radio telescope produced from a radio broadcasting
tower. Furthermore, <TT>pycraf</TT> provides functionality to
calculate atmospheric attenuation as proposed in ITU-R Rec.
P.676 (ITU-R, 2013). \\Using the rich
ecosystem of scientific Python libraries and our <TT>pycraf</TT>
package, we performed a large number of compatibility studies.
Here, we will highlight a recent case study, where we analysed
the potential harm that the next-generation cell-phone standard
5G could bring to observations at a radio observatory. For this
we implemented a Monte-Carlo simulation to deal with the quasi-
statistical spatial distribution of base stations and user
devices around the radio astronomy station.},

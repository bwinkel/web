 abstract = {Today, image denoising by thresholding of wavelet coefficients is a
commonly used tool for 2D image enhancement. Since the data
product of spectroscopic imaging surveys has two spatial
dimensions and one spectral dimension, the techniques for
denoising have to be adapted to this change in dimensionality.
In this paper we will review the basic method of denoising data
by thresholding wavelet coefficients and implement a 2D-1D
wavelet decomposition to obtain an efficient way of denoising
spectroscopic data cubes. We conduct different simulations to
evaluate the usefulness of the algorithm as part of a source
finding pipeline.},

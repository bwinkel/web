abstract: Today, image denoising by thresholding of wavelet coefficients is a commonly
  used tool for 2D image enhancement. Since the data product of spectroscopic imaging
  surveys has two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension, the techniques for
  denoising have to be adapted to this change in dimensionality. In this paper we
  will review the basic method of denoising data by thresholding wavelet coefficients
  and implement a 2D-1D wavelet decomposition to obtain an efficient way of denoising
  spectroscopic data cubes. We conduct different simulations to evaluate the usefulness
  of the algorithm as part of a source finding pipeline.

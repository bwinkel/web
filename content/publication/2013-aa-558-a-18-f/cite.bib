 abstract = {Context. Extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies are chemically, and
possibly dynamically, primordial objects in the local Universe.
\ Aims: Our objective is to characterize the H i
content of the XMP galaxies as a class, using as a reference the
list of 140 known local XMPs compiled by Morales-Luis et al.
(2011). \ Methods: We have observed 29 XMPs, which
had not been observed before at 21 cm, using the Effelsberg
radio telescope. This information was complemented with H i data
published in literature for a further 53 XMPs. In addition,
optical data from the literature provided morphologies, stellar
masses, star-formation rates and metallicities. \
Results: Effelsberg H i integrated flux densities are between 1
and 15 Jy km s$^-1$, while line widths are between 20 and 120
km s$^-1$. H i integrated flux densities and line widths from
literature are in the range 0.1-200 Jy km s$^-1$ and 15-150 km
s$^-1$, respectively. Of the 10 new Effelsberg detections, two
sources show an asymmetric double-horn profile, while the
remaining sources show either asymmetric (seven sources) or
symmetric (one source) single-peak 21 cm line profiles. An
asymmetry in the H i line profile is systematically accompanied
by an asymmetry in the optical morphology. Typically, the g-band
stellar mass-to-light ratios are
åisebox-0.5ex~0.1, whereas the H i gas mass-
to-light ratios may be up to two orders of magnitude larger.
Moreover, H i gas-to-stellar mass ratios fall typically between
10 and 20, denoting that XMPs are extremely gas-rich. We find an
anti-correlation between the H i gas mass-to-light ratio and the
luminosity, whereby fainter XMPs are more gas-rich than brighter
XMPs, suggesting that brighter sources have converted a larger
fraction of their H i gas into stars. The dynamical masses
inferred from the H i line widths imply that the stellar mass
does not exceed 5% of the dynamical mass, while the H i mass
constitutes between 20 and 60% of the dynamical mass.
Furthermore, the dark matter mass fraction spans a wide range,
but can account, in some cases, for over 65% of the dynamical
mass. XMPs are found to be outliers of the mass - and luminosity
- metallicity relation, whereby they lack metals for their
estimated dynamical mass and luminosity, suggesting the presence
of pristine gas. However, they generally follow the luminosity -
and baryonic mass Tully-Fisher relation, indicating that the H i
gas is partly virialized and contains some rotational support.
60% of the XMP sources show a small velocity offset (10-40 km
s$^-1$) between the H i gas and the stellar/nebular component,
implying that, in these sources, the H i gas is not tightly
coupled to the stars and ionized gas. The effective yields
provided by oxygen are often larger than the standard
theoretical yields, suggesting that the observed H i gas is
relatively metal-free. 80% of the XMP sources present
asymmetric optical morphology - 60 XMPs show cometary structure,
11 show two bright star-forming knots and 18 show multiple star-
forming regions. Star-formation rates are found to be similar to
those typically found in BCDs. However, specific star-formation
rates are high, with timescales to double their stellar mass, at
the current rate, of typically less than 1 Gyr. \
Conclusions: XMP galaxies are among the most gas-rich objects in
the local Universe. The observed H i component suggests
kinematical disruption and hints at a primordial composition.

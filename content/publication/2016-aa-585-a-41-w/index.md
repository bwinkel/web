abstract: "Context. The Effelsberg-Bonn H I Survey (EBHIS) is a new 21-cm survey performed
  with the 100-m telescope at Effelsberg. It covers the whole northern sky out to
  a redshift of z åisebox-0.5ex~ 0.07 and comprises H I line emission from the Milky
  Way and the Local Volume.  Aims: We aim to substitute the northern-hemisphere part
  of the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn Milky Way H I survey (LAB) with this first EBHIS data
  release, which presents the H I gas in the Milky Way regime.  Methods: The use of
  a seven-beam L-band array made it feasible to perform this all-sky survey with a
  100-m class telescope in a reasonable amount of observing time. State-of-the-art
  fast-Fourier-transform spectrometers provide the necessary data read-out speed,
  dynamic range, and spectral resolution to apply software radio-frequency interference
  mitigation. EBHIS is corrected for stray radiation and employs frequency-dependent
  flux-density calibration and sophisticated baseline-removal techniques to ensure
  the highest possible data quality.  Results: Detailed analyses of the resulting
  data products show that EBHIS is not only outperforming LAB in terms of sensitivity
  and angular resolution, but also matches the intensity-scale of LAB extremely well,
  allowing EBHIS to be used as a drop-in replacement for LAB. Data products are made
  available to the public in a variety of forms. Most important, we provide a properly
  gridded Milky Way H I column density map in HEALPix representation. To maximize
  the usefulness of EBHIS data, we estimate uncertainties in the H I column density
  and brightness temperature distributions, accounting for systematic effects. EBHIS
  Milky Way HI data is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=``http://cdsar
  c.u-strasbg.fr''>http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=``http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-

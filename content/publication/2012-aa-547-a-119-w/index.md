abstract: We report on a novel method to solve the basket-weaving problem. Basket-
  weaving is a technique that is used to remove scan-line patterns from single-dish
  radio maps. The new approach applies linear least-squares and works on gridded maps
  from arbitrarily sampled data, which greatly improves computational efficiency and
  robustness. It also allows masking of bad data, which is useful for cases where
  radio frequency interference is present in the data. We evaluate the algorithms
  using simulations and real data obtained with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope.

 abstract = {We report on a novel method to solve the basket-weaving problem. Basket-
weaving is a technique that is used to remove scan-line patterns
from single-dish radio maps. The new approach applies linear
least-squares and works on gridded maps from arbitrarily sampled
data, which greatly improves computational efficiency and
robustness. It also allows masking of bad data, which is useful
for cases where radio frequency interference is present in the
data. We evaluate the algorithms using simulations and real data
obtained with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope.},

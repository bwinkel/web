abstract: Starting in winter 2008/2009 an L-band seven-feed-array receiver is used
  for a 21 cm line survey performed with the 100 m telescope, the Effelsberg-Bonn
  H I survey (EBHIS). The EBHIS will cover the whole northern hemisphere for decl.
  > - 5° comprising both the galactic and extragalactic sky out to a distance of about
  230 Mpc. Using state-of-the-art FPGA-based digital fast Fourier transform spectrometers,
  superior in dynamic range and temporal resolution to conventional correlators, allows
  us to apply sophisticated radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation schemes.
  In this paper, the EBHIS data reduction package and first results are presented.
  The reduction software consists of RFI detection schemes, flux and gain-curve calibration,
  stray-radiation removal, baseline fitting, and finally the gridding to produce data
  cubes. The whole software chain is successfully tested using multi-feed data toward
  many smaller test fields (1-100 deg$^2$) and recently applied for the first time
  to data of two large sky areas, each covering about 2000 deg$^2$. The first large
  area is toward the northern galactic pole and the second one toward the northern
  tip of the Magellanic Leading Arm. Here, we demonstrate the data quality of EBHIS
  Milky Way data and give a first impression on the first data release in 2011.

 abstract = {Starting in winter 2008/2009 an L-band seven-feed-array receiver is used
for a 21 cm line survey performed with the 100 m telescope, the
Effelsberg-Bonn H I survey (EBHIS). The EBHIS will cover the
whole northern hemisphere for decl. > - 5°
comprising both the galactic and extragalactic sky out to a
distance of about 230 Mpc. Using state-of-the-art FPGA-based
digital fast Fourier transform spectrometers, superior in
dynamic range and temporal resolution to conventional
correlators, allows us to apply sophisticated radio frequency
interference (RFI) mitigation schemes. In this paper, the EBHIS
data reduction package and first results are presented. The
reduction software consists of RFI detection schemes, flux and
gain-curve calibration, stray-radiation removal, baseline
fitting, and finally the gridding to produce data cubes. The
whole software chain is successfully tested using multi-feed
data toward many smaller test fields (1-100 deg$^2$) and
recently applied for the first time to data of two large sky
areas, each covering about 2000 deg$^2$. The first large area
is toward the northern galactic pole and the second one toward
the northern tip of the Magellanic Leading Arm. Here, we
demonstrate the data quality of EBHIS Milky Way data and give a
first impression on the first data release in 2011.},

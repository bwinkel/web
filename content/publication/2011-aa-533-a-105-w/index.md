abstract: Using Milky Way data of the new Effelsberg-Bonn H i Survey (EBHIS) and the
  Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS), we present a revised picture of the high-velocity
  cloud (HVC) complex Galactic center negative (GCN). Owing to the higher angular
  resolution of these surveys compared to previous studies (e.g., the Leiden Dwingeloo
  Survey), we resolve complex GCN into lots of individual tiny clumps, that mostly
  have relatively broad line widths of more than 15 km s$^-1$. We do not detect a
  diffuse extended counterpart, which is unusual for an HVC complex. In total 243
  clumps were identified and parameterized which allows us to statistically analyze
  the data. Cold-line components (i.e., ensuremathΔv$_fwhm$ < 7.5 km s$^-1$) are found
  in about 5% only of the identified cloudlets. Our analysis reveals that complex
  GCN is likely built up of several subpopulations that do not share a common origin.
  Furthermore, complex GCN might be a prime example for warm-gas accretion onto the
  Milky Way, where neutral H i clouds are not stable against interaction with the
  Milky Way gas halo and become ionized prior to accretion.

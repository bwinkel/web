 abstract = {Using Milky Way data of the new Effelsberg-Bonn H i Survey (EBHIS) and
the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS), we present a revised picture
of the high-velocity cloud (HVC) complex Galactic center
negative (GCN). Owing to the higher angular resolution of these
surveys compared to previous studies (e.g., the Leiden Dwingeloo
Survey), we resolve complex GCN into lots of individual tiny
clumps, that mostly have relatively broad line widths of more
than 15 km s$^-1$. We do not detect a diffuse extended
counterpart, which is unusual for an HVC complex. In total 243
clumps were identified and parameterized which allows us to
statistically analyze the data. Cold-line components (i.e.,
\ensuremathΔv$_fwhm$ < 7.5 km s$^-1$) are found in
about 5% only of the identified cloudlets. Our analysis reveals
that complex GCN is likely built up of several subpopulations
that do not share a common origin. Furthermore, complex GCN
might be a prime example for warm-gas accretion onto the Milky
Way, where neutral H i clouds are not stable against interaction
with the Milky Way gas halo and become ionized prior to
accretion.},

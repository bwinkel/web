 abstract = {Aims: We study the properties of low-column density gas clumps in the
halo of the Milky Way based on high-resolution 21-cm
observations. \Methods: Using interferometric data
from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) and the
Very Large Array (VLA), we studied H i emission at low-,
intermediate- and high radial velocities along four lines of
sight towards the quasars QSO J0003- 2323, QSO B1331+170, QSO
B0450-1310, and J081331+254503. Along these sightlines we had
previously detected weak Ca ii and Na i absorbers in the optical
spectra of these quasars. \Results: The analysis of
the high-resolution H i data reveals several compact and cold
clumps of neutral gas at velocities similar to the optical
absorption. The clumps have narrow H i line widths in the range
of 1.8 \ensuremathłeq v$_FWHM$ \ensuremathłeq 13.0
km s$^-1$, yielding upper limits for the kinetic temperature
of the gas of 70 \ensuremathłeq T$_max$
\ensuremathłeq 3700 K. The neutral gas has low H i column
densities in the range of 5 × 10$^18$...3
× 10$^19$ cm$^-2$. All clumps have angular
sizes of only a few arcminutes. \Conclusions: Our
high-resolution 21-cm observations indicate that many of the Ca
ii and Na i absorbers seen in our optical quasar spectra are
associated with low-column density H i clumps on small angular
scales. This suggests that, next to the massive, high-column
density neutral gas clouds in the halo (the common 21-cm low-,
intermediate-, and high-velocity clouds, LVCs, IVCs, and HVCs),
a population of low-mass, neutral gas structures exists in the
halo and remain mostly unseen in the existing 21-cm all-sky
surveys of IVCs and HVCs. One of our absorbers may be associated
with the Magellanic Stream, two intermediate-velocity clouds are
probably part of the Intermediate-Velocity Spur and the Low-
latitude IV arch, respectively. The remaining systems could be
located either in the lower halo or in the disk of the Milky
Way. The estimated thermal gas pressures of the detected H i
clumps are consistent with what is expected from theoretical
models of gas in the inner and outer Milky Way halos.},

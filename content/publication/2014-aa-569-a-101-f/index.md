abstract: 'Context. Source extraction for large-scale H i surveys currently involves
  large amounts of manual labor. For data volumes expected from future H i surveys
  with upcoming facilities, this approach is not feasible any longer.  Aims: We describe
  the implementation of a fully automated source finding, parametrization, and classification
  pipeline for the Effelsberg- Bonn H i Survey (EBHIS). With future radio astronomical
  facilities in mind, we want to explore the feasibility of a completely automated
  approach to source extraction for large- scale H i surveys.  Methods: Source finding
  is implemented using wavelet denoising methods, which previous studies show to be
  a powerful tool, especially in the presence of data defects. For parametrization,
  we automate baseline fitting, mask optimization, and other tasks based on well-
  established algorithms, currently used interactively. For the classification of
  candidates, we implement an artificial neural network, which is trained on a candidate
  set comprised of false positives from real data and simulated sources. Using simulated
  data, we perform a thorough analysis of the algorithms implemented.  Results: We
  compare the results from our simulations to the parametrization accuracy of the
  H i Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) survey. Even though HIPASS is more sensitive
  than EBHIS in its current state, the parametrization accuracy and classification
  reliability match or surpass the manual approach used for HIPASS data.'

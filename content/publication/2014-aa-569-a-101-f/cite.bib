 abstract = {Context. Source extraction for large-scale H i surveys currently
involves large amounts of manual labor. For data volumes
expected from future H i surveys with upcoming facilities, this
approach is not feasible any longer. \ Aims: We
describe the implementation of a fully automated source finding,
parametrization, and classification pipeline for the Effelsberg-
Bonn H i Survey (EBHIS). With future radio astronomical
facilities in mind, we want to explore the feasibility of a
completely automated approach to source extraction for large-
scale H i surveys. \ Methods: Source finding is
implemented using wavelet denoising methods, which previous
studies show to be a powerful tool, especially in the presence
of data defects. For parametrization, we automate baseline
fitting, mask optimization, and other tasks based on well-
established algorithms, currently used interactively. For the
classification of candidates, we implement an artificial neural
network, which is trained on a candidate set comprised of false
positives from real data and simulated sources. Using simulated
data, we perform a thorough analysis of the algorithms
implemented. \ Results: We compare the results from
our simulations to the parametrization accuracy of the H i
Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) survey. Even though HIPASS is
more sensitive than EBHIS in its current state, the
parametrization accuracy and classification reliability match or
surpass the manual approach used for HIPASS data.},

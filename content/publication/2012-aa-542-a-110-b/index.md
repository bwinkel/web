abstract: " Aims: We aim at analysing systematically the distribution and physical
  properties of neutral and mildly ionised gas in the Milky Way halo, based on a large
  absorption-selected data set.  Methods: Multi-wavelength studies were performed
  combining optical absorption line data of Ca ii and Na i with follow-up H i 21-cm
  emission line observations along 408 sight lines towards low- and high-redshift
  QSOs. We made use of archival optical spectra obtained with UVES/VLT. H i data were
  extracted from the Effelsberg-Bonn H i survey and the Galactic All-Sky survey. For
  selected sight lines we obtained deeper follow-up observations using the Effelsberg
  100-m telescope.  Results: Ca ii (Na i) halo absorbers at intermediate and high
  radial velocities are present in 40-55% (20-35%) of the sightlines, depending on
  the column density threshold chosen. Many halo absorbers show multi-component absorption
  lines, indicating the presence of sub-structure. In 65% of the cases, absorption
  is associated with H i 21-cm emission. The Ca ii (Na i) column density distribution
  function follows a power-law with a slope of ensuremathβ ensuremath≈ -2.2 (-1.4).\
  \  Conclusions: Our absorption-selected survey confirms our previous results that
  the Milky Way halo is filled with a large number of neutral gas structures whose
  high column density tail represents the population of common H i high- and intermediate-velocity
  clouds seen in 21-cm observations. We find that Na i/Ca ii column density ratios
  in the halo absorbers are typically smaller than those in the Milky Way disc, in
  the gas in the Magellanic Clouds, and in damped Lyman ensuremathα systems. The small
  ratios (prominent in particular in high-velocity components) indicate a lower level
  of Ca depletion onto dust grains in Milky Way halo absorbers compared to gas in
  discs and inner regions of galaxies. Full Table 1 is only available at the CDS via

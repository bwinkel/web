 abstract = {\ Aims: We aim at analysing systematically the distribution
and physical properties of neutral and mildly ionised gas in the
Milky Way halo, based on a large absorption-selected data set.
\ Methods: Multi-wavelength studies were performed
combining optical absorption line data of Ca ii and Na i with
follow-up H i 21-cm emission line observations along 408 sight
lines towards low- and high-redshift QSOs. We made use of
archival optical spectra obtained with UVES/VLT. H i data were
extracted from the Effelsberg-Bonn H i survey and the Galactic
All-Sky survey. For selected sight lines we obtained deeper
follow-up observations using the Effelsberg 100-m telescope.
\ Results: Ca ii (Na i) halo absorbers at
intermediate and high radial velocities are present in 40-55%
(20-35%) of the sightlines, depending on the column density
threshold chosen. Many halo absorbers show multi-component
absorption lines, indicating the presence of sub-structure. In
65% of the cases, absorption is associated with H i 21-cm
emission. The Ca ii (Na i) column density distribution function
follows a power-law with a slope of \ensuremathβ
\ensuremath≈ -2.2 (-1.4). \ Conclusions:
Our absorption-selected survey confirms our previous results
that the Milky Way halo is filled with a large number of neutral
gas structures whose high column density tail represents the
population of common H i high- and intermediate-velocity clouds
seen in 21-cm observations. We find that Na i/Ca ii column
density ratios in the halo absorbers are typically smaller than
those in the Milky Way disc, in the gas in the Magellanic
Clouds, and in damped Lyman \ensuremathα systems. The
small ratios (prominent in particular in high-velocity
components) indicate a lower level of Ca depletion onto dust
grains in Milky Way halo absorbers compared to gas in discs and
inner regions of galaxies. \\Full

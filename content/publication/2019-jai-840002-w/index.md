abstract: Modern radio astronomical facilities are able to detect extremely weak electromagnetic
  signals not only from the universe but also from man-made radio frequency interference
  of various origins. These range from wanted signals to unwanted out-of-band emission
  of radio services and applications to electromagnetic interference produced by all
  kinds of electronic and electric devices. Energy harvesting wind turbines are not
  only equipped with electric power conversion hardware but also copious amounts of
  electronics to control and monitor the turbines. A wind turbine in the vicinity
  of a radio telescope could therefore lead to harmful interference, corrupting the
  measured astronomical data. Many observatories seek to coordinate placement of new
  wind farms with wind turbine manufacturers and operators, as well as with the local
  planning authorities, to avoid such a situation. In our study, we provide examples
  as well as guidelines for the determination of the separation distances between
  wind turbines and radio observatories, to enable a benign co-existence for both.
  The proposed calculations entail three basic steps. At first, the anticipated maximum
  emitted power level based on the European EN 550011 (CISPR, 2015) standard, which
  applies to industrial devices, is determined. Then secondly, the propagation loss
  along the path to the radio receiver is computed via a model provided by the international
  telecommunication union. Finally, the received power is compared to the permitted
  power limit that pertains in the protected radio astronomical observing band under
  consideration. This procedure may be carried out for each location around a telescope
  site, in order to obtain a map of potentially problematic wind turbine positions.

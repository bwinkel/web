abstract: We report on observations of 68 satellites belonging to the SpaceX Starlink
  constellation with the LOFAR radio telescope. Radiation associated with Starlink
  satellites was detected at observing frequencies between 110 and 188 MHz, which
  is well below the 10.7- 12.7 GHz radio frequencies used for the downlink communication
  signals. A combination of broad-band features, covering the entire observed bandwidth,
  as well as narrow-band (bandwidth < 12.2 kHz) emission at frequencies of 125, 135,
  143.05, 150, and 175 MHz, was observed. The presence and properties of both the
  narrow- and broad-band features vary between satellites at different orbital altitudes,
  indicating possible differences between the operational state of, or the hardware
  used in, these satellites. While the narrowband detections at 143.05 MHz can be
  attributed to reflections of radar signals from the French GRAVES Space Surveillance
  Radar, the signal properties of the broad- and narrow-band features at the other
  frequencies suggest that this radiation is intrinsic to the Starlink satellites
  and it is seen for 47 out of the 68 Starlink satellites that were observed. We observed
  spectral power flux densities vary from 0.1 to 10 Jy for broad-band radiation, to
  10 to 500 Jy for some of the narrow-band radiation, equivalent to electric field
  strengths of up to 49 dB [textmu V m$^ensuremath-1$] (as measured at a 10 m distance
  from the satellites, with a measurement bandwidth of 120 kHz). In addition, we present
  equivalent power flux density simulations of the full Starlink phase 1 constellation,
  as well as other satellite constellations, for one frequency band allocated to radio
  astronomy by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). With these, we calculate
  the maximum radiation level that each satellite constellation would need to have
  to comply with regulatory limits for intended emissions in that band. However, these
  limits do not apply if the radiation is unintended, that is to say if it does not
  originate from intentionally radiated signals for radio communication or other purposes.
  We discuss the results in light of the (absence of) regulations covering these types
  of unintended electromagnetic radiation and the possible consequences for astronomical
  radio observations.

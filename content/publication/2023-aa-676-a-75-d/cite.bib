 abstract = {We report on observations of 68 satellites belonging to the SpaceX
Starlink constellation with the LOFAR radio telescope. Radiation
associated with Starlink satellites was detected at observing
frequencies between 110 and 188 MHz, which is well below the
10.7- 12.7 GHz radio frequencies used for the downlink
communication signals. A combination of broad-band features,
covering the entire observed bandwidth, as well as narrow-band
(bandwidth < 12.2 kHz) emission at frequencies of 125, 135,
143.05, 150, and 175 MHz, was observed. The presence and
properties of both the narrow- and broad-band features vary
between satellites at different orbital altitudes, indicating
possible differences between the operational state of, or the
hardware used in, these satellites. While the narrowband
detections at 143.05 MHz can be attributed to reflections of
radar signals from the French GRAVES Space Surveillance Radar,
the signal properties of the broad- and narrow-band features at
the other frequencies suggest that this radiation is intrinsic
to the Starlink satellites and it is seen for 47 out of the 68
Starlink satellites that were observed. We observed spectral
power flux densities vary from 0.1 to 10 Jy for broad-band
radiation, to 10 to 500 Jy for some of the narrow-band
radiation, equivalent to electric field strengths of up to 49 dB
[\textmu V m$^\ensuremath-1$] (as measured at a 10 m
distance from the satellites, with a measurement bandwidth of
120 kHz). In addition, we present equivalent power flux density
simulations of the full Starlink phase 1 constellation, as well
as other satellite constellations, for one frequency band
allocated to radio astronomy by the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU). With these, we calculate the
maximum radiation level that each satellite constellation would
need to have to comply with regulatory limits for intended
emissions in that band. However, these limits do not apply if
the radiation is unintended, that is to say if it does not
originate from intentionally radiated signals for radio
communication or other purposes. We discuss the results in light
of the (absence of) regulations covering these types of
unintended electromagnetic radiation and the possible
consequences for astronomical radio observations.},

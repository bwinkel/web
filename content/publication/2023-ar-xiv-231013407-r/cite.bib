 abstract = {The Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies (CRAF) is an Expert
Committee of the European Science Foundation. It aims to provide
a cost-effective single voice on frequency protection issues for
European radio astronomy observatories and research institutes,
achieving a significantly greater impact than that achievable by
individual national institutions. By working together, European
observatories and institutes can profit from synergy effects,
cover many more topics, and learn from each other. CRAF was
founded in 1988 and has since then been engaged with the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in particular its
Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R), and the European Conference
of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) and its
European Communications Committee (ECC). This is the self-
evaluation report prepared by CRAF for its periodic review of
the years 2011-2021.},

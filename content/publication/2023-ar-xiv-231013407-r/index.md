abstract: The Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies (CRAF) is an Expert Committee
  of the European Science Foundation. It aims to provide a cost-effective single voice
  on frequency protection issues for European radio astronomy observatories and research
  institutes, achieving a significantly greater impact than that achievable by individual
  national institutions. By working together, European observatories and institutes
  can profit from synergy effects, cover many more topics, and learn from each other.
  CRAF was founded in 1988 and has since then been engaged with the International
  Telecommunication Union (ITU), in particular its Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R),
  and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT)
  and its European Communications Committee (ECC). This is the self- evaluation report
  prepared by CRAF for its periodic review of the years 2011-2021.

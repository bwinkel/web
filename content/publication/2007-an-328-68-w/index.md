abstract: 'In this paper we present an interference detection toolbox consisting of
  a high dynamic range Digital Fast-Fourier-Transform spectrometer (DFFT, based on
  FPGA-technology) and data analysis software for automated radio frequency interference
  (RFI) detection. The DFFT spectrometer allows high speed data storage of spectra
  on time scales of less than a second. The high dynamic range of the device assures
  constant calibration even during extremely powerful RFI events. The software uses
  an algorithm which performs a two-dimensional baseline fit in the time-frequency
  domain, searching automatically for RFI signals superposed on the spectral data.
  We demonstrate, that the software operates successfully on computer-generated RFI
  data as well as on real DFFT data recorded at the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. At
  21-cm wavelength RFI signals can be identified down to the 4ensuremathÏƒ_rms level.
  A statistical analysis of all RFI events detected in our observational data revealed
  that: (1) mean signal strength is comparable to the astronomical line emission of
  the Milky Way, (2) interferences are polarised, (3) electronic devices in the neighbourhood
  of the telescope contribute significantly to the RFI radiation. We also show that
  the radiometer equation is no longer fulfilled in presence of RFI signals.'

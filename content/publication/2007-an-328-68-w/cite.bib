 abstract = {In this paper we present an interference detection toolbox consisting of
a high dynamic range Digital Fast-Fourier-Transform spectrometer
(DFFT, based on FPGA-technology) and data analysis software for
automated radio frequency interference (RFI) detection. The DFFT
spectrometer allows high speed data storage of spectra on time
scales of less than a second. The high dynamic range of the
device assures constant calibration even during extremely
powerful RFI events. The software uses an algorithm which
performs a two-dimensional baseline fit in the time-frequency
domain, searching automatically for RFI signals superposed on
the spectral data. We demonstrate, that the software operates
successfully on computer-generated RFI data as well as on real
DFFT data recorded at the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. At 21-cm
wavelength RFI signals can be identified down to the
4\ensuremathÏƒ_rms level. A statistical analysis of all
RFI events detected in our observational data revealed that: (1)
mean signal strength is comparable to the astronomical line
emission of the Milky Way, (2) interferences are polarised, (3)
electronic devices in the neighbourhood of the telescope
contribute significantly to the RFI radiation. We also show that
the radiometer equation is no longer fulfilled in presence of
RFI signals.},

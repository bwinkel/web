     abstract = "{We report on observations of 68 satellites belonging to the SpaceX
        Starlink constellation with the LOFAR radio telescope. Radiation
        associated with Starlink satellites was detected at observing
        frequencies between 110 and 188 MHz, which is well below the
        10.7- 12.7 GHz radio frequencies used for the downlink
        communication signals. A combination of broad-band features,
        covering the entire observed bandwidth, as well as narrow-band
        (bandwidth < 12.2 kHz) emission at frequencies of 125, 135,
        143.05, 150, and 175 MHz, was observed. The presence and
        properties of both the narrow- and broad-band features vary
        between satellites at different orbital altitudes, indicating
        possible differences between the operational state of, or the
        hardware used in, these satellites. While the narrowband
        detections at 143.05 MHz can be attributed to reflections of
        radar signals from the French GRAVES Space Surveillance Radar,
        the signal properties of the broad- and narrow-band features at
        the other frequencies suggest that this radiation is intrinsic
        to the Starlink satellites and it is seen for 47 out of the 68
        Starlink satellites that were observed. We observed spectral
        power flux densities vary from 0.1 to 10 Jy for broad-band
        radiation, to 10 to 500 Jy for some of the narrow-band
        radiation, equivalent to electric field strengths of up to 49 dB
        [{\textmu} V m$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$] (as measured at a 10 m
        distance from the satellites, with a measurement bandwidth of
        120 kHz). In addition, we present equivalent power flux density
        simulations of the full Starlink phase 1 constellation, as well
        as other satellite constellations, for one frequency band
        allocated to radio astronomy by the International
        Telecommunication Union (ITU). With these, we calculate the
        maximum radiation level that each satellite constellation would
        need to have to comply with regulatory limits for intended
        emissions in that band. However, these limits do not apply if
        the radiation is unintended, that is to say if it does not
        originate from intentionally radiated signals for radio
        communication or other purposes. We discuss the results in light
        of the (absence of) regulations covering these types of
        unintended electromagnetic radiation and the possible
        consequences for astronomical radio observations.}",

        man-made radio frequency interference of various origins. These
        range from wanted signals to unwanted out-of-band emission of
        radio services and applications to electromagnetic interference
        produced by all kinds of electronic and electric devices. Energy
        harvesting wind turbines are not only equipped with electric
        power conversion hardware but also copious amounts of
        electronics to control and monitor the turbines. A wind turbine
        in the vicinity of a radio telescope could therefore lead to
        harmful interference, corrupting the measured astronomical data.
        Many observatories seek to coordinate placement of new wind
        farms with wind turbine manufacturers and operators, as well as
        with the local planning authorities, to avoid such a situation.
        In our study, we provide examples as well as guidelines for the

        determined. Then secondly, the propagation loss along the path
        to the radio receiver is computed via a model provided by the
        international telecommunication union. Finally, the received
        power is compared to the permitted power limit that pertains in
        the protected radio astronomical observing band under
        consideration. This procedure may be carried out for each
        location around a telescope site, in order to obtain a map of
        potentially problematic wind turbine positions.}",

        simple molecules against distant Galactic continuum sources have
        opened the possibility of studying the chemistry of diffuse
        molecular clouds throughout the Milky Way. In order to calculate
        abundances, the column densities of molecular and atomic
        hydrogen, H I, must be known. \textbackslash Aims: We aim at
        determining the atomic hydrogen column densities for diffuse
        clouds located on the sight lines toward a sample of prominent
        high-mass star-forming regions that were intensely studied with
        the HIFI instrument onboard Herschel. \textbackslash Methods:
        Based on Jansky Very Large Array data, we employ the 21 cm H I
        absorption-line technique to construct profiles of the H I
        opacity versus radial velocity toward our target sources. These
        profiles are combined with lower resolution archival data of
        extended H I emission to calculate the H I column densities of
        the individual clouds along the sight lines. We employ Bayesian
        inference to estimate the uncertainties of the derived

        estimates of the atomic hydrogen column density for a large
        number of diffuse molecular clouds at various Galactocentric
        distances. Together with column densities of molecular hydrogen
        derived from its surrogates observed with HIFI, the measurements

        science disciplines. It refers to the resampling of irregularly
        sampled data to a regular grid. \textbackslash Aims: We present
        cygrid, a library module for the general purpose programming
        language Python. Cygrid can be used to resample data to any
        collection of target coordinates, although its typical
        application involves FITS maps or data cubes. The FITS world
        coordinate system standard is supported. \textbackslash Methods:
        The regridding algorithm is based on the convolution of the
        original samples with a kernel of arbitrary shape. We introduce
        a lookup table scheme that allows us to parallelize the gridding
        and combine it with the HEALPix tessellation of the sphere for
        fast neighbor searches. \textbackslash Results: We show that for
        n input data points, cygrids runtime scales between O(n) and
        O(nlog n) and analyze the performance gain that is achieved
        using multiple CPU cores. We also compare the gridding speed
        with other techniques, such as nearest-neighbor, and linear and
        cubic spline interpolation. \textbackslash Conclusions: Cygrid
        is a very fast and versatile gridding library that significantly
        outperforms other third-party Python modules, such as the linear
        and cubic spline interpolation provided by SciPy.

        whole northern sky out to a redshift of z
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.07 and comprises H I line
        emission from the Milky Way and the Local Volume. \textbackslash
        Aims: We aim to substitute the northern-hemisphere part of the
        Leiden/Argentine/Bonn Milky Way H I survey (LAB) with this first
        EBHIS data release, which presents the H I gas in the Milky Way
        regime. \textbackslash Methods: The use of a seven-beam L-band
        array made it feasible to perform this all-sky survey with a
        100-m class telescope in a reasonable amount of observing time.
        State-of-the-art fast-Fourier-transform spectrometers provide
        the necessary data read-out speed, dynamic range, and spectral
        resolution to apply software radio-frequency interference
        mitigation. EBHIS is corrected for stray radiation and employs
        frequency-dependent flux-density calibration and sophisticated
        baseline-removal techniques to ensure the highest possible data
        quality. \textbackslash Results: Detailed analyses of the
        resulting data products show that EBHIS is not only
        outperforming LAB in terms of sensitivity and angular
        resolution, but also matches the intensity-scale of LAB
        extremely well, allowing EBHIS to be used as a drop-in
        replacement for LAB. Data products are made available to the
        public in a variety of forms. Most important, we provide a
        properly gridded Milky Way H I column density map in HEALPix
        representation. To maximize the usefulness of EBHIS data, we
        estimate uncertainties in the H I column density and brightness
        temperature distributions, accounting for systematic effects.

     abstract = "{Context. Extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies are chemically, and
        possibly dynamically, primordial objects in the local Universe.
        \textbackslash Aims: Our objective is to characterize the H i
        content of the XMP galaxies as a class, using as a reference the
        list of 140 known local XMPs compiled by Morales-Luis et al.
        (2011). \textbackslash Methods: We have observed 29 XMPs, which
        had not been observed before at 21 cm, using the Effelsberg
        radio telescope. This information was complemented with H i data
        published in literature for a further 53 XMPs. In addition,
        optical data from the literature provided morphologies, stellar
        masses, star-formation rates and metallicities. \textbackslash
        Results: Effelsberg H i integrated flux densities are between 1
        and 15 Jy km s$^{-1}$, while line widths are between 20 and 120
        km s$^{-1}$. H i integrated flux densities and line widths from
        literature are in the range 0.1-200 Jy km s$^{-1}$ and 15-150 km
        s$^{-1}$, respectively. Of the 10 new Effelsberg detections, two
        sources show an asymmetric double-horn profile, while the
        remaining sources show either asymmetric (seven sources) or
        symmetric (one source) single-peak 21 cm line profiles. An
        asymmetry in the H i line profile is systematically accompanied
        by an asymmetry in the optical morphology. Typically, the g-band
        stellar mass-to-light ratios are
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.1, whereas the H i gas mass-
        to-light ratios may be up to two orders of magnitude larger.
        Moreover, H i gas-to-stellar mass ratios fall typically between
        10 and 20, denoting that XMPs are extremely gas-rich. We find an
        anti-correlation between the H i gas mass-to-light ratio and the
        luminosity, whereby fainter XMPs are more gas-rich than brighter
        XMPs, suggesting that brighter sources have converted a larger
        fraction of their H i gas into stars. The dynamical masses
        inferred from the H i line widths imply that the stellar mass
        does not exceed 5\% of the dynamical mass, while the H i mass
        constitutes between 20 and 60\% of the dynamical mass.
        Furthermore, the dark matter mass fraction spans a wide range,
        but can account, in some cases, for over 65\% of the dynamical
        mass. XMPs are found to be outliers of the mass - and luminosity
        - metallicity relation, whereby they lack metals for their
        estimated dynamical mass and luminosity, suggesting the presence
        of pristine gas. However, they generally follow the luminosity -
        and baryonic mass Tully-Fisher relation, indicating that the H i
        gas is partly virialized and contains some rotational support.
        60\% of the XMP sources show a small velocity offset (10-40 km
        s$^{-1}$) between the H i gas and the stellar/nebular component,
        implying that, in these sources, the H i gas is not tightly
        coupled to the stars and ionized gas. The effective yields
        provided by oxygen are often larger than the standard
        theoretical yields, suggesting that the observed H i gas is
        relatively metal-free. 80\% of the XMP sources present
        asymmetric optical morphology - 60 XMPs show cometary structure,
        11 show two bright star-forming knots and 18 show multiple star-
        forming regions. Star-formation rates are found to be similar to
        those typically found in BCDs. However, specific star-formation
        rates are high, with timescales to double their stellar mass, at
        the current rate, of typically less than 1 Gyr. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: XMP galaxies are among the most gas-rich objects in
        the local Universe. The observed H i component suggests
        kinematical disruption and hints at a primordial composition.

        and physical properties of neutral and mildly ionised gas in the

        \textbackslash Methods: Multi-wavelength studies were performed
        combining optical absorption line data of Ca ii and Na i with
        follow-up H i 21-cm emission line observations along 408 sight
        lines towards low- and high-redshift QSOs. We made use of
        archival optical spectra obtained with UVES/VLT. H i data were
        extracted from the Effelsberg-Bonn H i survey and the Galactic
        All-Sky survey. For selected sight lines we obtained deeper
        follow-up observations using the Effelsberg 100-m telescope.
        \textbackslash Results: Ca ii (Na i) halo absorbers at
        intermediate and high radial velocities are present in 40-55\%
        (20-35\%) of the sightlines, depending on the column density
        threshold chosen. Many halo absorbers show multi-component
        absorption lines, indicating the presence of sub-structure. In
        65\% of the cases, absorption is associated with H i 21-cm
        emission. The Ca ii (Na i) column density distribution function
        follows a power-law with a slope of {\ensuremath{\beta}}
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} -2.2 (-1.4). \textbackslash Conclusions:
        Our absorption-selected survey confirms our previous results
        that the Milky Way halo is filled with a large number of neutral
        gas structures whose high column density tail represents the
        population of common H i high- and intermediate-velocity clouds
        seen in 21-cm observations. We find that Na i/Ca ii column
        density ratios in the halo absorbers are typically smaller than
        those in the Milky Way disc, in the gas in the Magellanic
        Clouds, and in damped Lyman {\ensuremath{\alpha}} systems. The
        small ratios (prominent in particular in high-velocity
        components) indicate a lower level of Ca depletion onto dust
        grains in Milky Way halo absorbers compared to gas in discs and
        inner regions of galaxies. \textbackslash\textbackslashFull

        the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS), we present a revised picture
        of the high-velocity cloud (HVC) complex Galactic center
        negative (GCN). Owing to the higher angular resolution of these
        surveys compared to previous studies (e.g., the Leiden Dwingeloo
        Survey), we resolve complex GCN into lots of individual tiny
        clumps, that mostly have relatively broad line widths of more
        than 15 km s$^{-1}$. We do not detect a diffuse extended
        counterpart, which is unusual for an HVC complex. In total 243
        clumps were identified and parameterized which allows us to
        statistically analyze the data. Cold-line components (i.e.,
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}v$_{fwhm}$ < 7.5 km s$^{-1}$) are found in
        about 5\% only of the identified cloudlets. Our analysis reveals
        that complex GCN is likely built up of several subpopulations
        that do not share a common origin. Furthermore, complex GCN
        might be a prime example for warm-gas accretion onto the Milky
        Way, where neutral H i clouds are not stable against interaction
        with the Milky Way gas halo and become ionized prior to
        accretion.}",

        release was published by McClure-Griffiths et al. (2009).
        \textbackslash Aims: We remove instrumental effects that affect
        the GASS and present the second data release. \textbackslash
        Methods: We calculate the stray-radiation by convolving the all-
        sky response of the Parkes antenna with the brightness
        temperature distribution from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB)
        all sky 21-cm line survey, with major contributions from the
        30-m dish of the Instituto Argentino de Radioastronom{\'\i}a
        (IAR) in the southern sky. Remaining instrumental baselines are
        corrected using the LAB data for a first guess of emission-free
        baseline regions. Radio frequency interference is removed by
        median filtering. \textbackslash Results: After applying these
        corrections to the GASS we find an excellent agreement with the
        Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) survey. The GASS is the highest
        spatial resolution, most sensitive, and is currently the most
        accurate H i survey of the Galactic H i emission in the southern
        sky. We provide a web interface for generation and download of

        halo of the Milky Way based on high-resolution 21-cm
        observations. \textbackslashMethods: Using interferometric data
        from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) and the
        Very Large Array (VLA), we studied H i emission at low-,
        intermediate- and high radial velocities along four lines of
        sight towards the quasars QSO J0003- 2323, QSO B1331+170, QSO
        B0450-1310, and J081331+254503. Along these sightlines we had
        previously detected weak Ca ii and Na i absorbers in the optical
        spectra of these quasars. \textbackslashResults: The analysis of
        the high-resolution H i data reveals several compact and cold
        clumps of neutral gas at velocities similar to the optical
        absorption. The clumps have narrow H i line widths in the range
        of 1.8 {\ensuremath{\leq}} v$_{FWHM}$ {\ensuremath{\leq}} 13.0
        km s$^{-1}$, yielding upper limits for the kinetic temperature
        of the gas of 70 {\ensuremath{\leq}} T$_{max}$
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} 3700 K. The neutral gas has low H i column
        densities in the range of 5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{18}$...3
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. All clumps have angular
        sizes of only a few arcminutes. \textbackslashConclusions: Our
        high-resolution 21-cm observations indicate that many of the Ca
        ii and Na i absorbers seen in our optical quasar spectra are
        associated with low-column density H i clumps on small angular
        scales. This suggests that, next to the massive, high-column
        density neutral gas clouds in the halo (the common 21-cm low-,
        intermediate-, and high-velocity clouds, LVCs, IVCs, and HVCs),
        a population of low-mass, neutral gas structures exists in the
        halo and remain mostly unseen in the existing 21-cm all-sky
        surveys of IVCs and HVCs. One of our absorbers may be associated
        with the Magellanic Stream, two intermediate-velocity clouds are
        probably part of the Intermediate-Velocity Spur and the Low-
        latitude IV arch, respectively. The remaining systems could be
        located either in the lower halo or in the disk of the Milky
        Way. The estimated thermal gas pressures of the detected H i
        clumps are consistent with what is expected from theoretical
        models of gas in the inner and outer Milky Way halos.}",

        LSFS utilizes not only two but a set of three or more local
